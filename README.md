# Brute-Force-Hack
this is a project I was working on to teach myself requests in Python. The code is pretty simple. To see it run, you can download it and change the parts of the code to appropriate values. The example website I used when testing the code (my own website made with Flask, as I didn't want to use the program on someone else's website) took in three arguments for login (email, password, remember (boolean to determine if the user stays logged in)). The file is a commonly available file that contains a list of common passwords. The program works by sending requests to the server and constantly checking for the "true" keyword in the response text, which is contained in the text string that my website returns on successful login. This value would need to be changed depending on the code the website returns on successful vs. unsuccessful login. For the program to work, you must replace "true" with and text that appears in the response text on successful login, but NOT in the failed login.
